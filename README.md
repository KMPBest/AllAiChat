## Benefits of KMP
- Code sharing: With KMP, you can write shared code that can be used across multiple platforms, such as Android and iOS.
- Single-language development: KMP enables you to use Kotlin as the primary programming language for both the shared code and platform-specific code.
- Consistent business logic: KMP allows you to implement and share business logic, network calls, data models, and other core functionalities across platforms.
- Faster time to market: By sharing code and leveraging KMP's cross-platform capabilities, developers can significantly reduce development time and effort.
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Native platform integration: KMP allows seamless integration with platform-specific APIs, libraries, and UI components.
